    <h3>About me </h3>
    <p>This is my first ever try at HTML.</p>
    <p>1.0.0 will be done without any JavaScript</p>
    <p>My name is Alex Perry and this is my first ever development of an HTML site.
        I am a sophomore at East Carolina University studying Computer Science.
        I am looking forward to learning more about web development.
        I am passionate about machine learning, data science, data analysis, data visualization, 
        data mining, and data warehousing, and I am eager to learn more about these fields in 
        the future. Each of these areas fascinates me, and Iâ€™m excited to deepen 
        my knowledge and skills to make meaningful contributions in these rapidly evolving domains.
    </p>
    <p>I have worked at jobs at Fayetteville parks and recreation and Chick-Fil-A, 
        both which are very customer service oriented.
        I love to learn new things and I am always looking for new opportunities to grow.
